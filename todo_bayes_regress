We are refactoring the project into purely a differentiable linear and logistic regression package.
And also using infogain

Steps:- stabilize hessian algorithm
- port linear regression and logistic regression things to GPU
- visualize them


- understand why the logistic regression with Newton method converges very poorly. And fix convergence issues
- write convnet and MLP with the logistic regression as output

- refactor all code into nn modules
- include prior precision attenuation every minibatch, so we allow for learning
- include radial basis functions
