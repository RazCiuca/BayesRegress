We are refactoring the project into purely a differentiable linear and logistic regression package.
And also using infogain

Steps:

- write prior_optimisation for logistic regression using pytorch gradients
- refactor all code into nn modules
- include prior precision attenuation every minibatch, so we allow for learning
- include radial basis functions
