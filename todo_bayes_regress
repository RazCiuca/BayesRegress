We are refactoring the project into purely a differentiable linear and logistic regression package.
And also using infogain

Steps:

- finish coding logistic regression + differentiable estimate
- test logistic regression
- write prior_optimisation for logistic regression
    -> estimate model likelihood using importance sampling from the gaussian approximation and the real posterior
- refactor all code into nn modules
- include prior precision attenuation every minibatch, so we allow for learning
- include radial basis functions
